# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by emailing security@laberit.com. Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Dependencies Management

- **Regular Updates**: Run `npm audit` weekly in all application directories
- **Automated Alerts**: GitHub Dependabot is enabled for security updates
- **Lock Files**: Always commit `package-lock.json` to ensure reproducible builds
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Regularly review and remove unused dependencies

### 2. Secrets Management

- **Never commit secrets**: API keys, passwords, or tokens must never be in the repository
- **Environment Variables**: Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive configuration
- **`.env` files**: Listed in `.gitignore` and never committed
- **Rotation**: Rotate all secrets quarterly

### 3. Build Pipeline Security

- **Least Privilege**: GitHub Actions workflows use minimal required permissions
- **Pinned Actions**: All actions are pinned to specific versions
- **No Direct Commits**: All changes go through pull requests
- **Build Isolation**: Each build runs in an isolated environment

### 4. Code Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **XSS Prevention**: React's built-in protections are maintained
- **HTTPS Only**: All external resources use HTTPS
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented where applicable

### 5. Access Control

- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires pull request reviews
- **2FA Required**: All contributors must have 2FA enabled
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly review of repository access
- **Minimal Permissions**: Contributors get only necessary permissions
