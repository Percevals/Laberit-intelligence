# The Immunity Framework 2.0: An Executive's Guide to Corporate Biology

## Executive Summary

Traditional cybersecurity audits are failing business leaders. They provide technical checklists and generic scores, but don't answer the question that truly matters to the C-suite: **Will our business survive a sophisticated cyber attack?**

The Immunity Framework 2.0 views your business as a living organism, measuring resilience across three critical, interconnected pillars—**The Immunity Trinity**:

## The Immunity Trinity

### 1. Protection Effectiveness (Your Armor)
- **What It Is**: Your organization's preventative defenses - the armor that stops threats before they get inside
- **How We Measure**: 
  - Protection Readiness Score (architectural maturity)
  - Protection Performance Score (real-world testing)
- **C-Level Value**: Answers "Is the money we're spending on defense actually making us safer?"

### 2. Operational Resilience (Your DNA)
- **What It Is**: Your business model's inherent risk profile based on digital dependency, industry, and geography
- **How We Measure**: Business Exposure Index (BEI) combining:
  - Industry Vulnerability (25%)
  - Digital Dependency (40%)
  - Decision Speed (20%)
  - Geographic Risk (15%)
- **C-Level Value**: Transforms cybersecurity from IT issue to strategic planning component

### 3. Detection & Response Agility (Your Immune System)
- **What It Is**: Your ability to find and neutralize threats that breach your armor
- **How We Measure**:
  - Response Readiness Score (process maturity)
  - Response Performance Score (MTTD + MTTC)
- **C-Level Value**: Answers "When a threat gets in—and it will—do we survive?"

## The Formula: An Engine for Clarity

**True resilience is a product of balanced strengths.**

```
Immunity Index = (Protection × Resilience × Agility) / 20
```

Where:
- **Protection** = Protection Readiness × Protection Performance
- **Resilience** = 1 + (1 - BEI × 0.5)
- **Agility** = Response Readiness × Response Performance

Result: A 0-10 score that executives can understand and act upon.

## Performance Scoring Tiers

### Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) - 50 points max
| Tier | Benchmark | Points | Business Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Elite | <10 minutes | 50 | "Automated, machine-speed detection" |
| Advanced | 10 min - 1 hour | 40 | "Team alerted almost immediately" |
| Competent | 1-24 hours | 25 | "Problems found same day" |
| Basic | 1-7 days | 10 | "Reliant on manual reviews" |
| Lacking | >7 days | 0 | "Attacker has free reign" |

### Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) - 50 points max
| Tier | Benchmark | Points | Business Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Elite | <30 minutes | 50 | "Breach stopped before spread" |
| Advanced | 30 min - 4 hours | 40 | "Contained within hours" |
| Competent | 4-72 hours | 25 | "Stopped within days" |
| Basic | 3-14 days | 10 | "Week of disruption" |
| Lacking | >14 days | 0 | "Extinction-level event" |

## The Immunity Trinity Radar

A visual signature that transforms complex data into strategic insight:

- **Balanced Leader**: Large equilateral triangle (strong, stable)
- **The Fortress**: Narrow spike toward Protection (rigid, fragile)
- **The Exposed**: Tiny triangle at center (vulnerable, high-risk)

## Dual-Audience Reporting

- 1-2 page executive summary
- Leads with Operational Resilience
- Business risk and strategic implications
- Investment priorities

### Technical Roadmap (CIO/CISO)
- Full detailed report
- Deep dive into all pillars
- 48 sub-control breakdowns
- Specific service recommendations

## Service Mapping by Pillar
