# Enhanced Economic Analysis Documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The Enhanced Compromise Score now includes intelligent economic analysis that:
- Asks for company revenue context before showing generic loss estimates
- Calculates realistic hourly impact based on business model resilience
- Shows time-phased degradation (0â†’10%â†’40%â†’80% loss)
- Provides interactive what-if scenarios with ROI calculations
- References peer comparisons with similar companies

## ðŸ“Š Key Components

### 1. RevenueContext Component
Collects company size/revenue information through:
- **Range Selection**: Quick selection from predefined ranges
- **Specific Input**: Exact monthly revenue entry
- **Multi-Currency**: Support for USD, EUR, MXN, COP, ARS, CLP, BRL
- **Business Context**: Shows why revenue matters for their business model

### 2. EconomicImpactCalculator Component
Provides intelligent calculations including:
- **Phased Impact Timeline**:
  - Hours 0-6: Usually $0 (undetected phase)
  - Hours 6-24: 10% degradation Ã— digital dependency
  - Hours 24-72: 40% degradation Ã— digital dependency  
  - Hours 72+: 80% critical loss Ã— digital dependency
- **Business Model Intelligence**: Factors natural resilience (e.g., Hybrid Commerce physical fallback)
- **Peer Comparisons**: "Similar $5M retailer faced $47K incident"
- **Visual Timeline**: Graph showing operational capacity over time

### 3. ImpactWhatIfSimulator Component
Interactive sliders to adjust:
- **Detection Time**: 1-24 hours (affects when losses start)
- **% Operations Affected**: 10-100% (scales total impact)
- **Recovery Speed**: 5x faster to 2x slower
- **Investment Packages**: None, Basic ($50K), Advanced ($200K), Comprehensive ($500K)

Shows real-time:
- Side-by-side impact comparison (before/after improvements)
- Savings calculation and percentage reduction
- ROI analysis (investment cost, annual savings, payback period, 5-year ROI)
- AI-powered DII score projections

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Revenue-Based Calculations
```javascript
// Hourly revenue from monthly
hourlyRevenue = monthlyRevenue / (30 * 24)

// Phased impact calculation
if (hour <= detectionTime) impact = 0
else if (hour <= 24) impact = hourlyRevenue * 0.1 * digitalDependency
else if (hour <= 72) impact = previousPhase + (hourlyRevenue * 0.4 * digitalDependency)
else impact = allPreviousPhases + (hourlyRevenue * 0.8 * digitalDependency)
```

### Business Model Factors
Each model has specific characteristics affecting impact:
- **Digital Dependency**: 20-100% (how much relies on digital systems)
- **Natural Redundancy**: None/Low/Medium/High (fallback options)
- **Resilience Window**: Hours before revenue impact begins
- **Critical Factor**: Key vulnerability for that model

### Investment Impact Modeling
Investments improve three key metrics:
1. **Detection Time**: Earlier detection = less undetected damage
2. **Recovery Speed**: Faster recovery = lower total loss
3. **Blast Radius**: Fewer operations affected = reduced impact scale

## ðŸ’¡ User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Assessment** â†’ Shows basic compromise probability
2. **User Clicks Economic Tab** â†’ Prompted for revenue context
3. **Revenue Provided** â†’ Shows personalized impact calculations
4. **Peer Comparison** â†’ "You're above/below industry average"
5. **What-If Tab Enabled** â†’ Interactive improvement scenarios
6. **Investment Selection** â†’ See ROI and payback calculations

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

- **Tabbed Interface**: Clean separation of analysis types
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green (0-6h): Undetected phase
  - Orange (6-24h): Initial degradation
  - Red (24-72h): Significant impact
  - Dark Red (72h+): Critical loss
- **Interactive Elements**: Sliders provide immediate visual feedback
- **Comparison Views**: Side-by-side before/after impact

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Scenarios

### Small Retailer (Comercio HÃ­brido)
- Monthly Revenue: $250K
- Digital Dependency: 30-60%
- Undetected Period: 24-48h (physical ops continue)
- 72h Impact: ~$15K (vs $47K peer average)
- With $50K investment: Reduce to $8K, ROI in 11 months

### Fintech (Servicios Financieros)  
- Monthly Revenue: $5M
- Digital Dependency: 95-100%
- Undetected Period: 0-2h (immediate impact)
- 72h Impact: ~$650K (above $500K peer average)
- With $200K investment: Reduce to $320K, ROI in 7 months

### SaaS Provider (Software CrÃ­tico)
- Monthly Revenue: $1M
- Digital Dependency: 70-90%
- Undetected Period: 6-24h
- 72h Impact: ~$125K (matches peer average)
- With $500K investment: Reduce to $45K, ROI in 18 months

## ðŸ”„ AI Integration

The system uses AI (or intelligent offline calculations) to:
- Adjust compromise probability based on revenue scale
- Generate peer comparison data
- Project DII improvements from investments
- Suggest optimal investment levels based on company size
