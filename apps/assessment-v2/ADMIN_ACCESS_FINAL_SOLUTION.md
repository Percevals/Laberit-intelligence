# Admin Interface - Final Solution

## The Problem
GitHub Pages doesn't support SPA routing for applications deployed in subdirectories. The 404.html trick only works at the repository root level, not for paths like `/Laberit-intelligence/apps/assessment-v2/`.

## The Solution
Since we cannot use direct URL access on GitHub Pages, we've made the admin interface easily accessible through navigation:

### Access Methods

#### 1. Primary Access (Recommended)
Visit the home page and use the prominent navigation options:
- **URL**: https://percevals.github.io/Laberit-intelligence/apps/assessment-v2/
- **Option A**: Click "Admin Panel" button in the top navigation bar
- **Option B**: Scroll down to the "Company Management" section and click "Open Admin Panel"

#### 2. Bookmark-Friendly Workaround
1. Visit: https://percevals.github.io/Laberit-intelligence/apps/assessment-v2/
2. Click on Admin Panel to navigate to the admin interface
3. Bookmark the resulting URL for future direct access (the URL will show `/admin` but only works after the app loads)

## Technical Details
- Removed the 404.html approach as it doesn't work in GitHub Pages subdirectories
- Enhanced the home page with clear admin navigation options
- Made the admin button more prominent in the header
- Added a dedicated admin section on the home page

## Alternative Deployment Options
If direct URL access is critical, consider:
1. **Deploy to Netlify/Vercel**: These platforms properly support SPA routing
2. **Use a custom domain**: GitHub Pages at root domain level supports the 404.html trick
3. **Separate repository**: Deploy assessment-v2 as its own GitHub Pages site

## For Developers
During local development, direct access works perfectly:
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:5173/Laberit-intelligence/apps/assessment-v2/admin
```

The limitation only affects the GitHub Pages deployment due to how it handles static file serving in subdirectories.
