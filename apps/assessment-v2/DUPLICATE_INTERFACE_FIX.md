# Duplicate Interface Fix

## Problem
The ImmunityTimelineNavigation component was showing interactive questions within the timeline cards, creating a duplicate interface where users could answer questions in two places - the timeline and the main content area.

## Solution
Removed the interactive question display from the timeline navigation component to ensure questions only appear in the main content area.

## Changes Made

### 1. **ImmunityTimelineNavigation.tsx**
- Removed the question and response options display from active dimension cards
- Replaced with a simple "Answering now..." indicator for active dimensions
- Removed `onResponseSelect` prop from the interface
- Removed `onResponseSelect` parameter from DimensionCard component

### 2. **AdaptiveImmunityBuildingPage.tsx**
- Removed `onResponseSelect` prop from ImmunityTimelineNavigation usage

### 3. **ImmunityBuildingPage.tsx**
- Removed `onResponseSelect` prop and empty handler function

### 4. **ImmunityTimelineDemo.tsx**
- Commented out unused `handleResponseSelect` function
- Removed `onResponseSelect` prop from component usage

### 5. **ImmunityTimelinePage.tsx**
- Commented out unused `handleResponseSelect` function
- Commented out unused helper functions: `getMetricForDimension`, `convertResponseToMetric`
- Commented out unused import: `addScenarioResponse`

## Result
- The timeline navigation now serves as a pure progress indicator and navigation tool
- Questions are only displayed in the main content area (right side)
- No more duplicate interfaces or confusion about where to answer questions
- Clean separation of concerns: navigation vs. question answering
- Successful build with no TypeScript errors
