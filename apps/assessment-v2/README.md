## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev:v2

# Or from this directory
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with code splitting
- **Performance**: Sub-second calculations
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript, no `any`
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80%+

## 🔗 Integration Points

- Intelligence service at `/intelligence/`
- Breach data from weekly reports
- Business model mapping to threats
- Real-time threat correlation

## 🎨 Design System

- **Colors**: DII maturity stages (fragil, robusto, resiliente, adaptativo)
- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code
- **Components**: Glass morphism, dark theme
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Complete assessment flow UI
2. Integrate with intelligence data
3. Add report generation
4. Implement caching strategy
5. Add E2E tests
6. Performance optimization

## 🔒 Security

- No storage of assessment data
- Client-side only calculations
- Anonymous metrics only
- No PII collection
