# Production Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Company Search Error - "No pudimos buscar su empresa"
**Problem**: Company search fails in production because API keys are not available in GitHub Pages environment.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `ai-config.ts` to force mock mode when no API keys are available in production
- Added console warning to indicate mock mode is being used

### 2. Manual Entry Error - "Algo sali√≥ mal"
**Problem**: When selecting manual entry, the CompanyInfo object lacked required fields, causing errors in CompanyConfirmationPage.

**Solution**:
- Updated `handleManualEntry` in `CompanySearchInput.tsx` to initialize all required fields with default values:
  - employees: 0
  - revenue: 0
  - country: ''
  - industry: ''
  - description: ''
  - headquarters: ''

### 3. Client-Side Routing 404 Error
**Problem**: Refreshing the page on routes like `/assessment/confirm` returns 404 on GitHub Pages.

**Solution**:
- Created `public/404.html` that redirects to index.html with route information
- Updated redirect handling to use proper query parameter

### 4. Translation Error - "ReferenceError: t is not defined"
**Status**: The EditableField component already has proper useTranslation import. The error might be a symptom of the routing/initialization issues rather than a direct translation problem.

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
The application expects these environment variables for full functionality:
- `VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY`: Mistral AI API key
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key

Without these, the app will run in mock mode with limited search functionality.

### GitHub Pages Limitations
1. No server-side routing - handled with 404.html redirect
2. No environment variables - app falls back to mock mode
3. Base path must match repository structure: `/Laberit-intelligence/apps/assessment-v2/`

### Manual Company Entry Flow
Users can still use the assessment by:
1. Searching for a company (will show mock results or error)
2. Clicking "Ingresar manualmente" (Enter manually)
3. Filling in company details on the confirmation page
4. Proceeding with the assessment

## Next Steps

To fully resolve the production issues:

1. **Option A**: Deploy to a platform that supports environment variables (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. **Option B**: Implement a proxy server to handle API calls securely
3. **Option C**: Enhance the mock mode to provide a better demo experience without real API calls
