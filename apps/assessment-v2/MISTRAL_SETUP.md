# Mistral AI Integration Setup Guide

## Step 1: Get Your Free Mistral API Key

1. Go to [Mistral Console](https://console.mistral.ai/)
2. Create a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy your API key (starts with `mr-...`)

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the assessment-v2 directory:
```bash
cd apps/assessment-v2
touch .env.local
```

2. Add your Mistral API key to `.env.local`:
```env
VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY=mr-your-actual-api-key-here
```

**Important**: `.env.local` is automatically ignored by git, so your API key stays secure.

## Step 3: Test the Integration

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open the assessment app in your browser
3. Go to company search and try searching for a real company
4. Check the browser console - you should see messages like:
   - `Searching with Mistral AI...`
   - `Company search completed using Mistral AI in XXXms`

## How It Works

The system automatically:

1. **Prioritizes Mistral**: If you have a Mistral API key, it becomes the primary provider
2. **Falls back gracefully**: If Mistral fails, it uses Mock data in development
3. **Caches results**: Successful searches are cached for 1 hour
4. **Respects rate limits**: Free tier allows 5 requests per minute
5. **Shows AI health**: Green dot indicates Mistral is working

## AI Health Indicator

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green (pulsing)**: Mistral AI is active and working
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Using cached data or fallback
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Manual entry only (no AI available)

## Free Tier Limits

Mistral free tier includes:
- **5 requests per minute**
- **mistral-small-latest model**
- **No cost** for basic usage

## Adding More Providers

To add OpenAI as a secondary provider, add to `.env.local`:
```env
VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY=mr-your-mistral-key
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
```

The system will try Mistral first, then OpenAI if Mistral fails.

## Troubleshooting

### "No results found"
- Check your API key is correct
- Verify you have internet connection
- Check browser console for errors

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait 1 minute and try again
- Consider upgrading to Mistral paid tier

### API Key not working
- Ensure the key starts with `mr-`
- Check it's properly set in `.env.local`
- Restart the development server after adding the key

## Success Indicators

When working correctly, you should see:
1. âœ… Real company data returned from searches
2. âœ… Green AI health indicator
3. âœ… Console logs showing "Mistral AI" as provider
4. âœ… Enhanced company information with confidence scores

The AI will help find companies, enhance missing data, and suggest business models based on industry analysis.
