# Assessment App - Next Steps Reference Document

## Current State Overview

The Assessment App is located at `/apps/assessment-v2/` and is built with:
- **React** (older version - needs evaluation)
- **Vite** as build tool
- **GitHub Pages** deployment
- **Monorepo structure** with Turborepo

## Critical Updates Needed

### 1. Dependency Audit & Updates
**Priority: HIGH** ðŸ”´

Current issues identified:
- Multiple npm audit warnings during GitHub Actions builds
- Legacy peer dependencies requiring `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies

**Action Items:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive audit
cd apps/assessment-v2
npm audit
npm outdated

# Document all critical/high vulnerabilities
# Evaluate React version and consider upgrade path
```

### 2. Integration with Intelligence Service
**Priority: HIGH** ðŸ”´

The intelligence service now provides:
- **Business Model Risk Mapping** (8 DII models)
- **Threat Intelligence Data** (OTX, IntelX)
- **Service Status Monitoring**
- **Weekly Intelligence Reports**

**Integration Points Needed:**
1. Import threat data from `/intelligence/data/`
2. Link to business model risk dashboard
3. Incorporate DII analysis into assessment results
4. Real-time threat correlation with assessment findings

### 3. Modular Development Plan

#### Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization
1. **Dependency Modernization**
   - Upgrade React to latest stable version
   - Update all critical dependencies
   - Remove legacy peer dependency requirements
   - Implement proper error boundaries

2. **Build System Optimization**
   - Ensure Turborepo integration is optimal
   - Configure proper caching strategies
   - Update Vite configuration for production builds

#### Phase 2: Core Feature Modules
1. **Assessment Engine Module**
   - Refactor assessment logic into standalone module
   - Create typed interfaces for all data structures
   - Implement proper state management (Context API or Zustand)

2. **Intelligence Integration Module**
   - Create API layer for intelligence data
   - Build components for threat visualization
   - Implement risk scoring based on DII models

3. **Reporting Module**
   - Standardize report generation
   - Add export capabilities (PDF, JSON, CSV)
   - Integrate with intelligence reports

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - WebSocket connection for live updates
   - Integration with service status dashboard
   - Alert system for critical findings

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Trend analysis over time
   - Predictive risk scoring
   - Compliance mapping (CIS, NIST, etc.)

## Technical Debt to Address

### Code Organization
```

â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ modules/           # New: Modular architecture

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/            # TypeScript definitions
```

### Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for all modules
- Add integration tests for intelligence service
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance benchmarks for large assessments

## Migration Path Recommendations

### Option 1: Incremental Upgrade (Recommended)
1. Create feature branch for modernization
2. Update dependencies incrementally
3. Refactor module by module
4. Maintain backward compatibility
5. Deploy progressively with feature flags

### Option 2: Parallel Development
1. Create `assessment-v2` as new app
2. Build with latest stack from scratch
3. Port features incrementally
4. Run both versions in parallel
5. Migrate users when stable

## Intelligence Service Integration Checklist

- [ ] Define data exchange format between services
- [ ] Create shared types/interfaces package
- [ ] Implement intelligence data fetching
- [ ] Build threat correlation engine
- [ ] Add business model risk visualization
- [ ] Create unified dashboard view
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for intelligence data
- [ ] Add real-time update capabilities

## Performance Considerations

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Lazy load intelligence modules
   - Optimize asset loading

2. **Data Management**
   - Implement proper caching
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Consider IndexedDB for offline support

3. **Build Performance**
   - Leverage Turborepo caching
   - Optimize CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement incremental builds

## Security Requirements

1. **Data Protection**
   - Implement proper sanitization
   - Add CSP headers
   - Secure API communications

2. **Authentication/Authorization**
   - Consider adding user management
   - Implement role-based access
   - Secure sensitive assessment data

## Deployment Strategy

1. **GitHub Pages Current Setup**
   - Maintain compatibility during upgrade
   - Update build paths if needed
   - Ensure proper redirects

2. **Future Considerations**
   - API backend requirements
   - Database needs for persistence
   - Scalability planning

## Decision Points for Next Session

1. **Upgrade vs. Rewrite?**
   - Evaluate current code quality
   - Time/resource constraints
   - Feature roadmap alignment
