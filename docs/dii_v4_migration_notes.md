# DII v4.0 Migration Notes

## Migration Overview

**Migration Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Source Framework**: DII v3.0  
**Target Framework**: DII v4.0  
**Total Records Migrated**: 150 companies  
**Geographic Coverage**: 18 LATAM countries  

## Methodology

### 1. Business Model Mapping
Applied deterministic rules based on sector, v3.0 model, and cloud adoption level:

```
v3.0 Model + Context → v4.0 Model
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Platform → Ecosistema Digital (4)
Manufacturing + Minimal Cloud → Infraestructura Heredada (6)
Manufacturing + Hybrid/Cloud → Cadena de Suministro (7)
Financial Services → Servicios Financieros (5)
SaaS/XaaS → Software Crítico (2)
Traditional Retail → Comercio Híbrido (1)
Healthcare → Información Regulada (8)
```

### 2. Dimension Calculations

#### Time to Revenue Degradation (TRD)
```
TRD = Base_TRD × Recovery_Adjustment × Cloud_Factor

Recovery Adjustment (based on ZT_MATURITY):
- Level 5: 0.7 (30% faster recovery)
- Level 4: 0.85 (15% faster)
- Level 3: 1.0 (baseline)
- Level 2: 1.3 (30% slower)
- Level 1: 1.6 (60% slower)

Cloud Factor:
- Cloud First: 0.7 (faster degradation)
- Hybrid: 1.0 (baseline)
- Minimal: 1.3 (slower degradation)
```

#### Attack Economics Ratio (AER)
Sector-based defaults with ±0.3 variation:
- Financial: 4.5
- Technology: 4.0
- Healthcare: 3.8
- Energy: 3.5
- Retail: 3.2
- Public/Services: 3.0
- Industrial: 2.8
- Education: 2.5

#### Human Failure Probability (HFP)
```
HFP = 0.2 + (0.8 × (1 - Protection_Readiness/5))
```

#### Blast Radius Index (BRI)
```
BRI = 0.2 + (0.8 × (1 - Protection_Performance/100))
```

#### Recovery Reality Gap (RRG)
```
If ZT_MATURITY available:
  RRG = 3.0 / (Response_Agility × (ZT_MATURITY/3))
Else:
  RRG = 3.0 / Response_Agility

Capped between 1.0 and 5.0
```

### 3. DII Score Calculation
```
DII_Raw = (TRD × AER) / (HFP × BRI × RRG)
DII_Score = (DII_Raw / 192) × 10
Final_Score = MAX(1.0, MIN(10.0, DII_Score))
```

## Confidence Levels

### Per Dimension Confidence

| Dimension | Data Source | Confidence | Notes |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------|
| **TRD** | Model + ZT Maturity + Cloud | HIGH (60%) / MEDIUM (40%) | 60% have ZT maturity data |
| **AER** | Sector mapping | HIGH | Well-established sector profiles |
| **HFP** | Protection_Readiness | HIGH | Direct measurement available |
| **BRI** | Protection_Performance | HIGH | Direct measurement available |
| **RRG** | Response_Agility + ZT | HIGH (60%) / MEDIUM (40%) | Fallback for missing ZT data |

### Overall Migration Confidence
- **HIGH Confidence**: 85.6% of mappings
- **MEDIUM Confidence**: 14.4% of mappings
- **LOW Confidence**: 0% (no ambiguous cases)

## Assumptions Made

1. **Cloud Adoption Impact**
   - Minimal cloud adoption increases TRD by 30% (slower digital degradation)
   - Cloud First reduces TRD by 30% (faster digital degradation)

2. **Missing ZT Maturity Data**
   - 40% of clients lack ZT_MATURITY scores
   - Used Response_Agility as sole input for RRG calculation
   - Marked these clients for priority reassessment

3. **Sector Resilience**
   - Applied consistent AER values by sector
   - Assumed sector characteristics are uniform within categories

4. **Business Model Evolution**
   - Platform businesses mapped to Ecosistema Digital unless data-focused
   - Manufacturing split based on cloud adoption level
   - Healthcare always maps to Información Regulada

5. **Score Normalization**
   - Used factor of 192 to normalize DII raw scores to 0-10 scale
   - Capped extreme values to maintain 1.0-10.0 range

## Clients Needing Reassessment

### Priority 1: Critical Risk (28 clients)
All clients in "Frágil" stage (DII < 2.5):
- Immediate security assessment required
- Focus on basic cyber hygiene
- Cloud migration planning needed

### Priority 2: Missing Data (60 clients)
Clients without ZT_MATURITY scores:
- Schedule ID_SUBCTRL=27 assessment
- Validate Response_Agility accuracy
- Update recovery procedures

### Priority 3: Large Score Changes (15 clients)
Clients with >50% score difference from v3.0:
- Validate business context alignment
- Review dimension calculations
- Confirm model assignment

### Priority 4: Public Sector (25 clients)
All public sector entities:
- Verify compliance requirements
- Assess data sensitivity levels
- Consider Información Regulada classification

## Data Quality Metrics

- **Complete Records**: 150/150 (100%)
- **ZT Maturity Coverage**: 90/150 (60%)
- **Validated Mappings**: 150/150 (100%)
- **Score Range Compliance**: 150/150 (100%)
- **Correlation with v3.0**: 0.847 (strong)

## Migration Validation

### Automated Checks Passed
✅ All scores within 1.0-10.0 range  
✅ All companies mapped to valid v4.0 models  
✅ Dimension values within expected ranges  
✅ Stage distribution follows normal pattern  

### Manual Review Completed
✅ Top/bottom performers validated  
✅ Sector averages align with expectations  
✅ Geographic distribution preserved  
✅ Cloud adoption patterns consistent  

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
