# DII Assessment Platform - Product Vision & Roadmap
## Building the Cyber Reality Check Tool (6-Month Horizon)

### Executive Summary

The Digital Immunity Index (DII) Assessment Platform delivers brutal honesty about cyber resilience. We show companies real breaches happening to businesses like theirs, ask the questions that actually matter, and provide fixes that work - not vendor BS.

**Core Philosophy**: "We don't predict your future. We show you the breaches happening right now to companies like yours."

---

## üéØ Product Vision (6 Months)

### What We're Building

A **Cyber Reality Check Platform** that:
- Shows real breach cases from companies like yours
- Asks 15 questions that would have prevented those breaches
- Calculates your "blast radius" when (not if) you're compromised
- Delivers actionable fixes based on what actually worked

### The Honest Value Proposition

> "In 5 minutes, see 3 companies like yours that got breached this quarter. In 30 minutes, know if you're next. No AI predictions. No vendor BS. Just truth and fixes."

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Principles

### 1. Evidence Over Predictions
- Show real breaches with verified costs
- Display actual attack methods used
- Focus on "this happened last month" not "this might happen"

### 2. Questions That Matter
- Based on actual attack vectors from our breach database
- Skip the obvious (everyone claims to have security)
- Focus on business logic and human factors

### 3. Assume Breach Mentality
- Start with "you're already compromised"
- Calculate blast radius and recovery time
- Show what similar companies faced

### 4. Anti-BS Approach
- Call out security theater
- Show which expensive tools didn't help
- Highlight cheap fixes that actually work

## üé¨ The Real Mission

We're not building another risk assessment tool. We're building the industry's first **Cyber Reality Check** that tells companies the truth about their risk based on what's actually happening, not theoretical frameworks.

**Remember**: Every feature must pass the "Would this have prevented a real breach?" test.
