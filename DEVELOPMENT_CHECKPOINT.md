# DII Assessment Platform v2 - Development Checkpoint
*Status: December 2024*

## 🎯 Current State Overview

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Core AI-Powered Assessment Flow**
The revolutionary "smart assessment" approach is **fully functional** with a 3-step user experience:

1. **Company Intelligence Search** → AI finds company data automatically
2. **Smart Confirmation** → User confirms/edits AI-discovered data  
3. **Business Model Reveal** → AI suggests business model with risk profile

### 🚀 **Major Breakthrough Achieved**
**Problem Solved**: Traditional assessments require 20+ tedious form fields  
**Solution Implemented**: AI-powered company search reduces input to just company name + critical infrastructure question

## 🎯 **Next Development Priorities**

### 🔥 **High Priority (Immediate)**
1. **Complete Core Assessment Engine** 
   - Implement 5 key DII questions with company context
   - Status: Architecture ready, needs question implementation
   - Impact: Core product functionality completion

2. **Results Dashboard & Reporting**
   - DII score calculation and visualization  
   - PDF report generation
   - Impact: Deliverable output for users

### 📊 **Medium Priority (Next Sprint)**
3. **Historical Data Integration**
   - Connect 150 companies dataset from `/intelligence/`
   - Add breach evidence when available
   - Impact: Data-driven insights and benchmarking

4. **Calculation Engine Unification**
   - Ensure Light and Premium versions use same engine
   - Status: Identified in modular architecture review
   - Impact: Consistency and maintainability

### 🔧 **Low Priority (Future Iterations)**
5. **UX Refinements**
   - Remove redundant "DII score" text
   - Mobile optimization improvements
   - Impact: Polish and user experience enhancement

## 🤔 **Strategic Decisions Needed**

### 1. **Product Roadmap Questions**
- **Priority**: Should we complete the core 5 DII questions first, or focus on advanced features?
- **Scope**: What level of customization do we want for different business models?
- **Integration**: How deep should the threat intelligence integration be in v2?

### 2. **Technical Architecture Decisions**
- **AI Strategy**: Should we add more AI providers (Anthropic Claude, local models)?
- **Data Strategy**: How should we handle user data persistence and privacy?
- **Scaling**: When do we need to consider backend API vs current client-side approach?

### 3. **Go-to-Market Considerations**  
- **Positioning**: How do we differentiate the AI-powered approach in marketing?
- **Pricing**: Should AI features be premium or core offering?
- **Rollout**: Beta testing strategy with LATAM customers?
