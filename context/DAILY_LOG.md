## 2025-01-14 - Measurement Questions Implementation

### What Changed
- Updated assessment from satisfaction-style to measurement questions (v2.0.0)
- Questions now ask for quantifiable metrics (hours, percentages, ratios)
- Added response options with specific metric values
- Implemented context help text for each business model
- Fixed TypeScript errors for v2.0.0 JSON structure

### What Broke
- Initial CI build failed due to network timeout (ECONNRESET)
- TypeScript assertion error with ScenarioMatrix type
- Fixed with `as unknown as ScenarioMatrix` assertion

### What Needs Decision
- Should we implement all 5 dimensions or keep light version at 1?
- How to handle metric validation (reasonable ranges)?
- Premium vs Light feature split strategy
- Navigation pattern for multiple dimension questions

### Key Files Modified
- `/src/core/types/pain-scenario.types.ts` - Added ResponseOption interface
- `/src/features/assessment/ScenarioQuestionCard.tsx` - Complete redesign
- `/src/services/assessment/response-interpreter.ts` - Added metric-based interpretation
- `/src/services/pain-scenarios/pain-scenario-service.ts` - Fixed type assertion
- `/data/business-model-scenarios.json` - Now v2.0.0 with measurement questions

### Notes for Next Session
- Only TRD dimension implemented - need other 4 dimensions
- Business model mapping is duplicated in 3 places (tech debt)
- No unit tests for the new ResponseInterpreter logic
- Assessment state persists incomplete data on page refresh

## 2025-01-13 - 8x5 Pain Discovery Matrix Integration

### What Changed
- Implemented complete 8x5 Business Model Pain Discovery Matrix
- Created type-safe PainScenarioService for scenario retrieval
- Added dynamic question adaptation based on company context
- Integrated scenario questions into assessment flow
- Connected responses to DII calculation engine

### What Broke
- BusinessModelId type conflicts between files
- Missing exports for interfaces
- Array indexing issues in response mapping

### What Needs Decision
- Order of dimension questions (priority vs formula order)
- Default values for missing dimensions
- Confidence thresholds for showing uncertainty

### Key Files Modified
- `/src/core/types/pain-scenario.types.ts` - Pain scenario types
- `/src/services/pain-scenarios/pain-scenario-service.ts` - Scenario retrieval
- `/src/services/question-adapter/question-adapter.ts` - Personalization
- `/src/pages/ScenarioQuestionsPage.tsx` - New question flow
- `/src/services/assessment/assessment-calculator.ts` - DII integration

### Notes for Next Session
- Question adapter ready for AI enhancement
- Need to implement navigation between dimensions
- Response persistence needs improvement

## 2025-01-14 - DII Business Models Implementation

### What Changed
- Replaced generic business models with 8 DII-specific models
- Created DIIBusinessModelClassifier with industry shortcuts
- Updated all model mappings throughout the codebase
- Maintained backwards compatibility with legacy models
- Airlines now correctly map to ECOSISTEMA_DIGITAL

### What Broke
- Initial TypeScript errors due to incomplete model replacements
- Fixed by adding union types for legacy support
- Some Record types needed to be Partial

### What Needs Decision
- Should we fully deprecate legacy models or keep permanent support?
- How to handle edge cases in industry classification?
- Need more specific industry mappings for Latin American context

### Key Files Modified
- `/src/core/types/business-model.types.ts` - Added DIIBusinessModel and LegacyBusinessModel types
- `/src/core/business-model/dii-classifier.ts` - New DII-specific classifier
- `/src/core/business-model/model-profiles-dii.ts` - DII model profiles
- `/src/pages/ClassificationPage.tsx` - Updated to use DIIBusinessModelClassifier
- `/src/pages/SmartClassificationPage.tsx` - Uses industry-based classification
- All response interpreters and calculators updated

### Notes for Next Session
- Industry classification now smarter (e.g., airlines â†’ ecosystems)
- Each DII model has specific cyber risk characteristics
- Response adjustments are model-specific
- Still only TRD dimension implemented
