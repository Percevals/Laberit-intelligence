# AER Enhancement Integration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully integrated the AER (Attack Economics Ratio) enhancements from `aer-enhancement.json` into the existing `business-model-scenarios.json` file.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated ONLY the AER sections** for all 8 business models
2. **Preserved all other dimensions** (TRD, HFP, BRI, RRG) exactly as they were
3. **Used the "light_scenario_express" method** from the enhancement design
4. **Adapted the AER question** for each business model's specific context

### Key Enhancement: Express Scenario-Based Economic Modeling

The new AER measurement approach asks a single, concrete question:

> "If a criminal group spent $10,000 attacking your organization (tools + time), considering [specific attack scenarios for your business model], what's the MAXIMUM they could potentially gain?"

### Business Model Adaptations

1. **Comercio Híbrido**: Focus on POS/e-commerce ransoms, customer data, operational losses
2. **Software Crítico**: Focus on service ransoms, all customer data, IP/source code
3. **Servicios Datos**: Focus on proprietary datasets, algorithms, competitive exclusivity
4. **Ecosistema Digital**: Focus on marketplace damage, mass fraud, ecosystem trust
5. **Servicios Financieros**: Focus on direct fund transfers, account access sales, operational extortion
6. **Infraestructura Heredada**: Focus on ransomware, decades of accumulated data, total paralysis
7. **Cadena Suministro**: Focus on shipment diversion, logistics intelligence, just-in-time disruption
8. **Información Regulada**: Focus on medical records black market, breach extortion, regulatory fines

### Response Scale

All models now use the same 5-option scale:
- Value 1: More than $2M USD (metric: 200)
- Value 3: $500K - $2M USD (metric: 100)
- Value 5: $100K - $500K USD (metric: 30)
- Value 7: $50K - $100K USD (metric: 7)
- Value 9: Less than $50K USD (metric: 3)

### Files Modified

- `business-model-scenarios.json`: Updated AER sections only
- `business-model-scenarios.backup.json`: Created backup of original file

### Verification

All 8 business models now have the enhanced AER measurement approach integrated, while maintaining the integrity of all other dimensions and file structure.
