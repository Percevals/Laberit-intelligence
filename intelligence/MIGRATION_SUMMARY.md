# Intelligence Module Reorganization Summary

## What Changed (July 11, 2025)

### ✅ Completed Actions

1. **Deleted**: Empty `weekly-reports 2/` folder
2. **Preserved**: All existing weekly report links remain functional
3. **Created**: New organized structure for future development
4. **Added**: Configuration files and requirements.txt

### 📁 New Structure

```
intelligence/
├── src/                    # Source code (organized)
├── config/                 # Configuration files
├── data/                   # Data storage
├── outputs/                # Generated outputs
├── docs/                   # Documentation
├── weekly-reports/         # PRESERVED for backward compatibility
└── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
```

### 🔗 Backward Compatibility

**Important**: Customer-shared links continue to work:
- `/intelligence/weekly-reports/immunity-dashboard-2025-06-20.html` ✅
- `/intelligence/weekly-reports/immunity-dashboard-2025-06-28.html` ✅
- `/intelligence/weekly-reports/immunity-dashboard-2025-07-04.html` ✅

These links will remain active until **August 11, 2025** (30 days).

### 🚀 What's Next

1. Original Python scripts remain in root (for now) to avoid breaking existing workflows
2. New development will use the `/src` structure
3. Gradual migration of active scripts
4. MVP development can begin immediately

### 📝 For Developers

- Install dependencies: `pip install -r intelligence/requirements.txt`
- Copy `config/api_keys.example.env` to `.env` and add your keys
- New modules go in `/src`
- Tests go in `/tests`

*This reorganization sets the foundation for the automated MVP pipeline while maintaining all existing functionality.*
